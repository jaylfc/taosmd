"""Derive the resume-pair PRIMARY arm time from the usage watcher's ACTUAL cron spec.

Usage:  resume_arm_time.py <resets_at ISO8601> [margin_seconds]
Prints: the arm instant (UTC), the 5-field cron line for a one-shot, and the
        evidence it used, so the caller can check the derivation rather than
        trust the number.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-16, bus 2774/2776/2777/2779, @taOSc-dev).
The resume pair kept waking inside the window where /home/jay/.taos-usage/current.json
still reports the PREVIOUS window's utilization. The gate read a file written by a
different component on its own schedule, so the wake landed in the gap by construction.

We fixed it three times and the first two fixes were the same mistake at different
scales:
  +2min  - tuned to nothing, always wrong.
  +7min  - tuned to the two instances in hand; still fails for r in {6,7,8} and is
           marginal at r=9, which is where BOTH real windows sit.
  +11min - correct for TODAY, but it is only `cadence + 1`. Nothing at the three
           hardcoded sites pointed back at the crontab line that made it true, so
           widening that cron to */15 would silently re-create the bug with no
           constant appearing to change.

So this script does not encode an offset at all. It reads the watcher's real cron
spec and arms strictly after the FIRST TICK FOLLOWING THE RESET, which is correct
for any phase AND any cadence, including a NON-UNIFORM tick list. Note the minute
field is an enumeration (`6,16,26,36,46,56`), not `*/10`: its uniformity is
incidental and must not be assumed.

It FAILS LOUD if it cannot find the watcher line. A gate whose PASS is reachable
from zero data is not a gate: silently falling back to a constant is exactly the
failure this replaces.

The offset is a LATENCY property, not the correctness fix. The correctness fix is
to gate on the STDOUT of usage_publish.sh and never on a re-read of current.json,
because that script does not write current.json at all.

MARGIN, and it is measured rather than assumed (2026-08-16). The margin only has to
cover the watcher's own run duration, i.e. the gap between the tick firing and
current.json being fully written. Two samples of that gap, taken from the file's
mtime against its tick: 2.336s (tick :56:00) and 1.755s (tick :36:00). So the write
lands about 2 seconds after its tick and the 60s default is roughly 25x headroom.
This also retires an open worry: the earlier +7 arm was NOT in fact racing the write
at r=9 (it woke 59s after the tick, which is ~28x the observed write time). +7's real
and sufficient defect was that it fails OUTRIGHT for r in {6,7,8}, which is a phase
error, not a race. Do not carry "+7 was marginal" forward as a race claim; it was
wrong for a different reason.

MARGIN_SECONDS = 60
#
# RETRY_LEAD_SECONDS is a function of THE PRIMARY'S FIRE-TO-DELETE LATENCY: how long the

# THE TABLE ABOVE IS EVIDENCE I HAVE NOT INDEPENDENTLY RE-DERIVED. It arrived by an
# unattributed write into this shared directory and is kept as documentation, NOT as the
# justification for a value change. A previous version of this block cited "the RED witness in
# test_resume_arm_time.py"; that witness does not exist in that file, and the suite stayed
# GREEN over the dangling citation (@taOSmd-dev, bus 2840). Citation removed rather than left
# pointing at nothing.
#
# THE LEAD IS NOT THE GAP, and both @taOSmd-dev and I argued about the wrong quantity first.
# retry_after() does not place the retry at primary+lead; it walks to the next WATCHER TICK
# whose fire clears the lead, so the tick lattice quantises the result. Reproduced here at the
# production spec (*/10 offset 6, reset 13:00Z, primary fire 13:07Z):
#     lead 0 / 60 / 599 / 600  -> retry 13:17Z, armed gap  600s   (identical)
#     lead 601                 -> retry 13:27Z, armed gap 1200s
# One boundary in the whole range. The suite already said so and we both read past it:
# "lead=-900: retry STILL lands after the primary" is lattice dominance, stated as a PASS.
#
# 60s is the smallest lead the production lattice can satisfy (the next tick is always >= 60s
# away) and is above the measured max of 49.729s. Under a dense spec where gap can equal lead,
# 60 leaves headroom against the observed max. Re-measure if the primary's wake path changes.
RETRY_LEAD_SECONDS = 60
#
# MIN_LEAD_SECONDS is a function of UPSTREAM ROLLOVER PROPAGATION: how long after the
# nominal reset instant the usage API actually serves the new window. That quantity is
# NOT MEASURED and 30 is a guess, stated as one rather than dressed as a derivation
# (@taOSc-dev, bus 2782, correctly noting it names nothing). It only binds when a tick
# falls within 30s of a reset, which the current 6-mod-10 spec never does; it was added
# for wide/aligned specs like */15 where a tick can land 0.2s after the reset. TO
# MEASURE: at a reset boundary, poll the API each second and record when the returned
# window flips. Until then this is the one honestly-unfounded number in the file.
MIN_LEAD_SECONDS = 30
#
# SCHEDULER_EARLY_JITTER_SECONDS is a function of THE SCHEDULER'S OWN CONTRACT, which is a
# layer MARGIN_SECONDS never named and which can undo it entirely. CronCreate documents:
# "one-shot tasks landing on :00 or :30 fire up to 90 s early". The resume pair are
# one-shots. So an arm computed at :00 or :30 with a 60s margin can fire 90s early, i.e.
# 30s BEFORE its own tick - exactly the race the margin exists to prevent, reintroduced by
# a dependency the margin did not declare.
# MEASURED by enumeration, not assumed: with ticks at :29 or :59 and the default margin the
# derived arm lands on :30 / :00 with a 60s lead, and 4 of the 6 reachable
# (tick, margin) combinations have a lead under the 90s jitter. TODAY'S REAL SPEC IS SAFE
# (ticks 6..56 arm at :07..:57, none jittered), which is precisely why this went unnoticed:
# correct by instance again. Found by reading the scheduler contract after @taOSc-dev
# (bus 2795) argued the conversion might not need to exist at all.

# A FOURTH LAYER, NAMED BUT NOT MODELLED (@taOSc-dev, bus 2798 (2); recorded here at the
# 08:4xZ retrospective, which caught that I had promised to record it HERE and had instead
# recorded it only on the bus and in my handoff - the two places nobody editing this file
# reads). DELIVERY: the scheduler states "Jobs only fire while the REPL is idle (not
# mid-query)." An arm derived correctly, encoded correctly, and jittered inside its declared
# 90s is still not delivered at its denoted instant if the REPL is busy then.
#
# Two asymmetries make this worse than the jitter, and neither is handled below:
#   - MARGIN_SECONDS is a ONE-SIDED guard. It buys clearance so the wake lands AFTER the
#     watcher's write, i.e. it bounds EARLY. Idle-gating is purely LATE, and unlike the 90s
#     the contract states NO BOUND on it at all.
#   - The inversion refusal in main() is a DERIVATION-time check on two cron lines. It can
#     only assert that the DENOTED order is primary-then-retry. IT CANNOT ASSERT THE FIRE
#     ORDER. What happens when two one-shots come due during one non-idle stretch and are
#     released together is NOT MEASURED and is not asserted here either way.
#
# Deliberately NOT fixed: every previous round of this file was made worse by acting on a
# mechanism nobody had read. TO MEASURE: arm two one-shots a minute apart, hold the REPL
# busy across both, and record the delivered order and lag.

# All FIVE cron fields are captured, not just the minute. The first version consumed
# hour/dom/month/dow as unanchored \S+ and never looked at them, so an hour-restricted or
# weekday-only watcher line matched, nothing failed, and the script derived an arm time
# asserting a write that never happens (@taOSc-dev, bus 2785; reproduced: a `... 8 * * *`
# watcher yielded a derived tick at 15:06 while the watcher only runs at hour 8). That is
# the ORIGINAL staleness bug rebuilt, with `EVIDENCE (read, not assumed)` printed above it.
# We do not model those fields, so we REFUSE them rather than model them wrong.

    direction. `fire.astimezone()` always yields a wall clock that EXISTS, so no derived
    instant can land in the skipped hour, and the spring-forward case is unreachable here
    rather than caught. The docstring said "the fold, the gap, and any dropped field"
    until the test showed otherwise. A guard advertising coverage it does not have is the
    same defect as a gate whose PASS is reachable from zero data.

    NOT CAUGHT, and stated rather than papered over: a 5-field cron line carries no YEAR,
    so this cannot detect a line left in place until next year. The one-shot semantics
    live at the scheduler layer (CronCreate with recurring=false), not in these five
    fields, so the representation is only complete in company with that flag.

    ceil-to-minute is what cron actually obeys and it can move a tick across the bound.
